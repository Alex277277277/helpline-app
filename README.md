Website with more information on this is here: **https://mhtech.in**

This is my first React Native App and took about 2 weeks to put together including time spent to learn React Native using a number of React Native tutorials online (so please be gentle with feedback).

**Pull Requests** <br />
Looking forward to pull requests on how we can make the app better and include best practices.

**Notes**
1. I have removed all the key files used to sign the project and generate the apks. Please find the tutorial here: https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/signed-apk-android.html incase you want to generate keys and create an apk for yourself.
2. The contacts functionality (where you pull in the device's contact list) is a slow process (I need to better do it) and we have reports of it crashing the app if you have more than 2,000 contacts.
3. I have also removed the online URLs which are used to push updates to the device for the data for security reasons.
4. I have also deleted all the **build** projects to reduce the size of this repository.
